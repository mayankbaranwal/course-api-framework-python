"""
In this chapter, we'll look at how do we work with JSON as well as use JSON Path to parse our JSON responses.
So, JSON is very popular data format these days and most of the APIs basically use it as the request and response
structure. It's also very useful for many Test Automation Purposes wherein you can use it as a data format to store 
your Test Data, even in Config or whats not?
So, its important ot take a grasp of that  
https://automationhacks.io/2020/12/25/python-api-automation-framework-part5-working-with-json

JSON is mostly a key:value data store and has support for some data primitive like string,number, boolean and also an 
array type it looks very similar to python dictionary. 
Let's understand some terms that comes quite frequently:
1. Serialization : 
The process of converting an Python Object to JSON.
2. Deserialization :
It's the reverse process of Serialization that's : 
Converting the JSON Object into the Python Object.
